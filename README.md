A girlâ€™s first period can be traumatizing, confusing, and shocking to experience when it happens. Oftentimes, girls have expectations or ideas about it that are not realistic. Much of this can be attributed to the stigma around talking about it. Introducing My First Period, an interactive game like application that allows young girls to learn about the realities of menstruation and resources available for them in a way that is easy to understand.

This project was built using Twine with Firebase as the backend.
